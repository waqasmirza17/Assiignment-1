    <pre style="color: white">
      In the night I hear 'em talk
      The coldest story ever told
      Somewhere far along this road
      He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
      How could you be so heartless?
      Oh, how could you be so heartless?
    </pre>

    <pre style="color: white">
      How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
      Just remember that you talkin' to me though
      You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
      I mean after all the things that we've been through
      I mean after all the things we got into
      Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
      Ayo, I did some things, but that's the old me
    </pre>

    <pre style="color: white">
      And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
      So you walk around like you don't know me
      You got a new friend, well, I got homies
      But in the end it's still so lonely
    </pre>

    <pre style="color: white">
      In the night I hear 'em talk
      The coldest story ever told
      Somewhere far along this road
      He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
      How could you be so heartless?
      Oh, how could you be so heartless?
    </pre>

    <pre style="color: white">
      How could be so Dr. Evil?
      You bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
      I decided we weren't gon' speak so
      Why we up 3:00 a.m. on the phone?
      Why do she be so mad at me for?
      Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
      I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
      'Cause I already know how this thing go
    </pre>

    <pre style="color: white">
      You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me (hey)
      They say that they don't see what you see in me (hey)
      You wait a couple months then you gon' see (hey)
      You'll never find nobody better than me
    </pre>

    <pre style="color: white">
      Talk and talk and talk and talk
      Baby let's just knock it off
      They don't know what we been through
      They don't know 'bout me and you
      So I got something new to see
      And you just gon' keep hatin' me
      And we just gon' be enemies
    </pre>

    <pre style="color: white">
      I know you can't believe
      I could just leave it wrong
      And you can't make it right
      I'm gon' take off tonight
      Into the night
    </pre>
